            Hello everyone, I am Sameer Poswal, a first year undergraduate at JC BOSE UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, YMCA, FARIDABDAD pursuing B.Tech in Electronics And Computer Engineering. A person exploring this crazy world and looking for some valuable opportunities in both TECH and NON-TECH sectors. Since childhood, I was always a tech enthusiast always fascinated with video games and different electronic machines in the childhood which gave birth to the desire of becoming an engineer. Would love to work in the field of Game Development and Artificial Intelligence in the future. Apart from all this stuff, I always get time to work on my personal fitness which is really necessary for a programmer to maintain the body and mind.  One word which describes me is "ENTHUSIASM".

        <p class="skills-content">
            Till now, I have gained a good experience in some skills. On some of them, I started working when I was 15, while some of them when I was 17 or there are some skills written below which I have mastered in a short span of 1 semester only. Some skills are technical while some are non-technical. But the common thing is my passion for each and every thing out there, I have pursued everything with an whole heart and I think that's why I got hands on them real quick.
